`run_ARmodel.m` compares control, FFT, and autoregressive forecasting.

`DreemPhaseTest.m` produces `\dreemAnalysis` and uses the libraries:

1. `dominantFFT.m`
2. `filterPhaseCorrection.m`

__Misc__

`run_EpiricPhaseDelay` was the prototype for `filterPhaseCorrection.m`; `run_FFTphaseTest` uses the empiric fit, includes a noisy sine input, and was used for the first blog post.
